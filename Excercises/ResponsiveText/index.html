    <h1>Rome </h1>
    <p><span>Rome</span> is a city and special comune (named Roma Capitale) in Italy. 
Rome is the capital of Italy and of the Lazio region. 
With 2.9 million residents in 1,285 km2 (496.1 sq mi), it is also the
country's largest and most populated comune and fourth-most populous
city in the European Union by population within city limits. 
</p>
    <p><span>The </span>Metropolitan City of Rome has a population of 4.3 million resident.
The city is located in the central-western portion of the Italian
Peninsula, within Lazio (Latium), along the shores of Tiber river.
The Vatican City is an independent country geographically located 
within the city boundaries of Rome, the only existing example of a 
country within a city: for this reason Rome has been often defined as 
capital of two states.
